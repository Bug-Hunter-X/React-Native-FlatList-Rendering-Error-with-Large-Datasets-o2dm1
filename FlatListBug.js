This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset. The error message is not very specific, but the root cause is usually related to the way the list is rendering and updating items.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

The `FlatList` component efficiently renders items by recycling views. If the key prop is not defined or not unique in each item of the dataset, the `FlatList` component might not update correctly causing this error. Also if the dataset changes frequently, without proper optimization, this could lead to performance issues and render errors.
